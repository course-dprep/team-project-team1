# A topic modeling study: The association between Yelp review sentiment and restaurant survival or closure
*Which aspects of the feedback provided by Yelp customer reviews are associated with restaurant closures?* 

## Motivation

Online customer reviews play a significant role in shaping how restaurants are perceived by consumers. When searching for new places to eat at, consumers may resort to customer review platforms, such as Yelp, to assess which would be worth giving a try. Therefore, the valence of a restaurant's reviews on several different aspects can impact its success, and ultimately, its survival. Restaurant closures are the endmost sign that a restaurant was unsuccessful as a business, which can happen for several reasons. The aim of this project is then to establish which, if any, aspects of customer reviews are associated to restaurant closures.
